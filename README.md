# Welcome!

This repo contains our effort to produce a Full Standard document for BGP, replacing RFC4271.

Here is our to-do list, plus the people working on each item. 
There are topics that we've agreed to include (Committed), in discussion, 
and topics that we've agreed should not be included (but could be referenced).

We've agreed that we do not want to try to boil the ocean and want the smallest change that gets us to a full standard.
